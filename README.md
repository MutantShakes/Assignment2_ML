In this report, Code wars tackles the task of building a classification model
to predict whether average humidity will surpass 50% the next day. Utilizing
a diverse meteorological dataset, our focus is on creating a robust model that
precisely classifies instances where humidity crosses this critical threshold. The
dataset, ranging from temperature metrics to atmospheric conditions, serves as
a valuable resource for training and evaluating our model. As we navigate the
intricacies of the data, our goal is to uncover meaningful patterns essential for
accurate predictions.
